creation
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__head=None
        self.__tail=None
    def get_head(self):
        return self.__head
    def get_tail(self):
        return self.__tail


display algorithm
display()
1. Call the head node as temp
2. While temp is not None,
   a. Display temp’s data
   b. Make the next node as temp

add operation
add(data)
1. Create a new node with the data
2. If the linked list is empty (head node is not referring to any other node), 
   make the head node and the tail node refer to the new node
3. Otherwise,
   a. Make the tail node’s link refer to new node
   b. Call the new node as tail node
